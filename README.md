# Transmitting short-packet over wireless channels—-an information-theoretic perspective

## Preface

In this set of lecture notes, we provide an introduction to some nonasymptotic tools in information theory that are useful in the design of latency-constrained transmission systems in which short-information packets are exchanged.
Compared to other available resources, the focus of these lecture notes is entirely on wireless communication channels. Although the notes are mostly self-contained, some knowledge of basic concepts in information theory such as channel capacity, and a familiarity with wireless communication channels is assumed.
These notes have been used as teaching material for the course [SSY210--Information Theory](https://pingpong.chalmers.se/public/courseId/10601/lang-en/publicPage.do?item=5208692) at Chalmers University of Technology.
